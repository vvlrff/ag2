"""``NetworkPlugin`` — attaches the network tool surface to an ``Agent``.

Two streams of LLM tools compose into an agent's tool list per turn:

* **Identity-level** (attached by ``NetworkPlugin`` once at registration,
  always available): ``peers`` / ``channels`` / ``tasks`` / ``context`` /
  ``delegate``. Cross-cutting verbs that work in any channel — discovery,
  channel lifecycle, task observation, and the one-shot ``delegate``
  convenience that opens its own consulting channel.

* **Channel-level** (resolved per turn by the default notify handler
  via ``adapter.tools_for(...)``): ``say`` for adapters that accept
  free-form text (consulting / conversation / discussion), user-authored
  handoff tools for workflow. Adapter-provided tools merge into the
  ``tools=`` override passed to ``agent.ask``.

The plugin appends ``NetworkContextPolicy`` to the agent's assembly
chain so every LLM call sees a "you are <name>" prefix.
