"""AlertPolicy — delivers observer alerts to the LLM via assembly.

Replaces the old Signal delivery system (SignalPolicy + SignalInjectionMiddleware).
AlertPolicy reads ObserverAlert events from the event stream and injects them
into the LLM prompt. FATAL alerts emit a HaltEvent on the stream.

Key behaviors preserved from the old system:
- Deduplication: each alert is injected once, then marked as delivered
- Cross-turn accumulation: reads alerts from stream history across LLM calls
- FATAL handling: emits HaltEvent for observers to halt execution
"""

from ag2.context import ConversationContext as Context
from ag2.events import BaseEvent, HaltEvent, ObserverAlert, Severity


class AlertPolicy:
    """Injects observer alerts into the LLM prompt.

    Reads ObserverAlert events from the event list, formats them as
    prompt text, and tracks which alerts have been delivered to avoid
    duplicates across LLM calls.

    Deduplication keys on ``(source, severity, message)`` — the semantic
    content of the alert, not the Python object identity — so dedup
    survives history replay, compaction (which rewrites history into
    fresh event objects), and serialization round-trips. Observers that
    need to re-alert with identical wording can vary the ``data`` dict
    or the ``message`` string.

    For FATAL alerts, emits a HaltEvent on the stream and adds a halt
    note to the prompt.

    Ordering: this is an injection policy. Place it after other injection
    policies (working memory, episodic memory) and before reduction policies
    (sliding window, token budget).
